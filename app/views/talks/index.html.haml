  %h1 What is This?
  %p Every year the Digital Media & IT program at NAIT will graduate between 30 and 50 web design & development students. As part of their education, each student will participate in a course called Capstone Project, in which they are given the opportunity to work on projects to strengthen their portfolio and otherwise gain experience working in scenarios which are closer to those found in industry.
