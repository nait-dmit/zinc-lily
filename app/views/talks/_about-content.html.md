## DMIT Industry Series 2013

Every year the Digital Media & IT program at NAIT will graduate between 30 and 50 web design & development students. As part of their education, each student will participate in a course called Capstone Project, in which they are given the opportunity to work on projects to strengthen their portfolio and otherwise gain experience working in scenarios which are closer to those found in industry.

This year we're hosting a series of talks by industry professionals aimed at helping emerging graduates discover more about the true nature of the web design &amp; development industry in Edmonton. While there will be a range of topics &ndash; both technical and non-technical &ndash; the source of the talks stem from practical, real-world experience from current industry professionals.

This is a great chance for industry to meet DMIT students getting ready to graduate in April, and for students to meet potential employers looking to add talented individuals to their teams this spring.

### Format

Each day of the series will feature two or three talks on various topics. Each talk will range from 30 minutes to 1 hour in length followed by a brief Q&A period. After each day of the event, we'll gather at the newly renovated [Nest Taphouse Grill](http://www.nesttaphousegrill.com/) here on NAIT's main campus for some food, drink, and conversation. It will be a great chance to chat with some emerging graduates and to field a few more questions from them.

Tickets are free, but seating for the talks is limited so please [grab your tickets soon](http://industryseries.eventbrite.com/) to join in. Tickets are not required to join us for socializing at the Nest afterwards, so feel free to join us there at around 4:30 pm each day, even if you can't make it to the talks.
